TODO

- Negamax makes no sense with old ideas 
    - Moves are not necessarily found, you would then assume stalemate...
    - Or every move is bad, yet you'll always select the last shit move with no distinction...
    - Extra run to print PV, delete

- Seeing AI capture own pieces?
- Finish castling
- En passant + old board state
- Can only apply moves from an internal move list 
- Add console.log support
- Investigate Webpack Wasm generation
